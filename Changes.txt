	- Add an option to sub new() to allow or disable old/new style scrolling.
		Read the POD for a full explanation of these styles.
		Note: The default is new style scrolling, because I feel it is more DWIM

	- Change scrolling algorithm in sub offset() to make it DWIM
	- Add sub current() to return the index of the 'current' item on the current page
	- Fix typo: 'bottom' should have been 'right' in some cases
